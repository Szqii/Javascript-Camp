# Week 1 - Server 
 
This project needs [Node.js Runtime ](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to run locally.


P.S.: [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) is used to deploy that app to online. 

There is an empty, customizable array [here.](https://javascript-hw1.herokuapp.com/)

|  Function |  Command |
|--|--|
| To add | ../add/:number |
| To delete | ../delete/:number|
| To update|../update/:target/:destination|
